# 6.ICE.1: NPM Webpack

## Introduction

Create a browser app with date inputs with Webpack.

## Base

1. Create a new NPM project and add the appropriate folders and files described in [Module 6.1.2: Webpack NPM](../6.1-webpack/6.1.2-webpack-with-npm-modules.md#initialise-project-folder).
2. Install [moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) as a dependency of the project.
3. When the page loads, create a date input.
4. When the user enters a date into the date input, show a Moment formatted date in an `h2` element. The date should have the format: **January 12th, 1998**.

## Comfortable

Add the [Copy to Clipboard library.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copy-to-clipboard) When the user clicks a button, copy a moment formatted short date to the clipboard. The date should have the format: **1/12/98**.

## More Comfortable

Use the [Moment Timezone library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment-timezone) to show the names and times at all other timezones in the world, in ascending order of difference from the user's current zone.
