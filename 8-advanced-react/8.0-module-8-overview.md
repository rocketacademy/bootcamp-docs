# 8.0: Module 8 Overview

## Introduction

We will learn advanced React concepts to incorporate in our apps as our apps get more complex. These concepts are optional but can be helpful in more complex apps.

1. Use Create React App to launch a standalone frontend server and connect it with our backend
2. Add advanced state management with Context
3. Refactor and reuse wrapper components with Higher-Order components
4. React Router - Deep linking into React
5. Advanced usage of `useEffect` with `setInterval`
6. Use CSS inside a component with Component Styling: CSS Modules, SASS and CSS classes
7. Use React Portals to set buttons outside the app
8. Use NPM component libraries to integrate APIs and more complex UI elements into our apps. Some examples below.
   1. File Upload: [React Dropzone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dropzone)
   2. Calendar date range picking
   3. Drag and drop - array / todo list ordering
