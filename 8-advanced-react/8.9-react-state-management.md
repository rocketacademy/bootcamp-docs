# 8.9: React State Management

One of the hallmarks of the React library is that the community has not centralized on a single way of doing things. This means that for each kind of functionality that you might want to add to a React app, there are many competing libraries.

State management refers to the library that manages data sent between components that is not passed as props. As we saw with `store.js` creating a system to manage data in the app makes it easier to pass data and manage data within the app. The context / reducer hooks `store.js` setup we created is not the only way to do this in a React app.

Flux is one of the original state management libraries. It was created sometime around 2014 at Facebook to help with managing React state.

#### Redux

Redux was meant to simplify Flux. Redux originated the idea of a reducer function that helps set state.

## GraphQL

Facebook also originated a back-end system that optimizes the REST API interface. This makes it so that the front-end can request for any model across all the data tables in the system. (For example an AJAX request that gets a user's posts and the comments and likes on that post and the number of shares on that post, etc.). The GraphQL back-end creation and setup is outside the scope of this page.

This back-end system is called GraphQL. With this new syntax for requesting data from the backend comes libraries that help manage the front-end data as well. This is because GraphQL enables a 1:1 relationship between the back-end data requested and the data in React state.

#### Relay

Relay is the official Facebook GraphQL state management library for React.

**Apollo**

Apollo React Library: [https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)

Apollo is the lighter-weight alternative to Relay. It is not supported by a single bug company. It also has support for the other major front-end libraries like Vue and Angular.

## Outsiders

#### MobX

[https://mobx.js.org](https://mobx.js.org/README.html)

MobX is referred to as a functional reactive state management library. (Confusingly React and _**reactive**_ are different.) It's based on a ideas that are not strictly JavaScript specific, and have been referred to as Rx: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReactiveX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReactiveX)
