# 8.ICE.1: useContext

## Introduction

The example e-commerce React app from [8.1.1: Create React App Full-Stack Setup](../8.1-create-react-app/8.1.1-create-react-app-full-stack-setup.md) uses prop functions to update state between sibling components, e.g. to add items to cart.

Refactor the app with `useContext` to store and access from context all state variables in `App` that are used in child components (`items`, `cart`, `selectedItemIndex`). Fork the frontend repo to make changes.

This exercise will help us understand the mechanics of `useContext` but in practice we would not use `useContext` for a simple app like this. `useContext` is best used in apps where we would need to pass state from parents to multiple descendants several levels deep.
