# 8.1.1: Create React App Full Stack Setup

We will now setup the previous ecommerce full-stack React app in the new Create React App architecture.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/CRA - arch 2.jpg>)

As described before, we will be using 2 completely different repositories to hold the frontend and the backend of the app.

1. The React app is deployed/started. The Webpack build process is triggered. The resulting files are put into the `/dist` directory, or in development mode, held in the Webpack dev server memory.
2. We type the React app location into the browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
3. The Create React App file server serves the HTML file and the React app JavaScript to the browser. The React app is initialized in the browser.
4. Clicking the "Get Items" button causes an AJAX request to be created inside the React app to: [http://localhost:3004/items](http://localhost:3004/items)
5. The request is received at the Express.js server. The app looks in the database for all items and sends back a JSON response.
6. The JSON data is received and processed by the React app. React manipulates the DOM to show the list of items on screen.

## Backend

The example backend repo is here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp)

Note that this is the same exact repo as this: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-mvc-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-mvc-bootcamp) from the end of module 4, except for CORS (discussed below).

Run the backend app:

```
git clone https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp.git
cd cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp
npm install
npx sequelize db:create
npx sequelize db:migrate
npx sequelize db:seed:all
node index.mjs
```

Test the app by visiting the route for items: [http://localhost:3004/items](http://localhost:3004/items)

## Frontend

The example frontend repo is here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp)

Clone and run the frontend app:

```
git clone https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp.git
cd cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp
npm start
```

Note that in order to reach our backend app we reference an environment variable ([prefixed with `REACT_APP_` for Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/)). We use environment variables to support different runtime environments, e.g. local backend vs production backend on Heroku. `BACKEND_URL` defaults to `localhost:3004` for development purposes. [Here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp/blob/main/src/App.jsx#L13-L14) is a link to the code.

```javascript
const BACKEND_URL =
  process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL || "http://localhost:3004";
```

When we make the AJAX request for the list of items we use `BACKEND_URL` to construct a complete URL. [Here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp/blob/main/src/App.jsx#L35) is a link to the code.

```javascript
axios.get(`${BACKEND_URL}/items`)
```

## CORS

### Introduction

When we deploy our app across multiple servers (frontend and backend), we will need to allow them to communicate with each other. To allow our frontend to communicate with our backend, we add [Express CORS middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html) as a dependency and use it in `index.mjs`. [Here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp/blob/main/index.mjs#L12-L15) is a link to the code.

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  credentials: true,
  origin: FRONTEND_URL
}));
```

CORS is a security feature of modern browsers that disallows AJAX requests to a domain that is different from the originating domain. This is to prevent attackers from pretending to be a legit client and stealing data from our backend servers.

In our case, our requests originate from localhost:3000 and we want to request data from our backend server at localhost:3004. These are different "origins", thus our browsers will disallow these requests by default. To enable such requests, we will need to enable CORS settings server-side. This will let browsers know that the target server allows such cross-origin requests, such that browsers allow such requests to be sent.

CORS security has both client-side and server-side components. The server controls which domains to whitelist. The client first checks its whitelist status with the target server using a "pre-flight request" before sending the actual request from the user application. If the pre-flight request fails due to CORS, the client browser will prevent the actual request from sending, citing CORS as the reason.

### CORS with cookies

The `cors` middleware also needs special instructions to send cookies from the frontend to the backend.

We specify the frontend server URL with the8.1. following code (link):

```javascript
const FRONTEND_URL = process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
```

And here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp/blob/main/index.mjs#L13-L14](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-bootcamp/blob/main/index.mjs#L13-L14)

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  credentials: true,
  origin: FRONTEND_URL
}));
```

#### Frontend

We tell our backend to allow requests from our frontend (specifying the frontend URL in `cors` middleware), and we tell our frontend to send cookie credentials to other servers (non-origin domains) in `axios` requests. [Here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-bootcamp/blob/main/src/App.jsx#L10-L11) is a link to the code for the latter. We will need to specify the following setting in every file where we import and use `axios`.

```javascript
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;
```

## Deployment

Create React App deployment works slightly differently from regular Heroku development in [3.8.1: Heroku Deploy](../../3-backend-applications/3.6-heroku/3.6.1-heroku-deploy.md). Please follow the Heroku Deployment instructions in CRA Docs [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#heroku) to deploy CRA apps.

## Exercise

Follow the above instructions to get the app working.
