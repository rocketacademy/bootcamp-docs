## **Full Stack App with Webpack**

We'll add front-end asset pre-compilation with Webpack, adding modules into our front-end code.

Front-end infrastructure means server-side libraries that we will run before the server is turned on, or, after we are done coding the front-end.

Having a workflow where we get to run tooling over our front-end code has many advantages, some of which we'll discuss in this module.

In a real-world production setting there may be many different layers of this front-end infrastructure, beyond the scope of what we'll discuss here, including CDNs and deployment build infrastructure.
