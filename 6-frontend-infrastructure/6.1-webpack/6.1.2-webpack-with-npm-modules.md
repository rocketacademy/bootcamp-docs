# 6.1.2: Webpack with NPM Modules

## Introduction

[Module 6.1.1: Webpack with Local Modules](6.1.1-webpack-with-local-modules.md) shared how Webpack can compile local modules into a distribution file. Here we will see how Webpack compiles 3rd-party NPM modules.

## Webpack Import with NPM Modules Order of Events

Webpack will transform the source JS file and all dependencies specified in import statements into a single distribution file.

1. `npm install` is run on the command line. The package files are stored in the `node_modules` directory.
2. The `webpack` command is run on the command line.
3. Webpack reads an `import` statement in the source `script.js` file.
4. Based on the `import`, Webpack retrieves all dependency code. If the imported module depends on other modules, Webpack retrieves those modules too.
5. Webpack writes the compiled file into the `dist` directory.
6. The server is started with `node index.js`. A request is made to the server. The server responds with the compiled JS file in `dist`.

## Webpack Import with NPM Modules Example

Begin with the same repo created in the previous section, 6.1.1: Webpack with Local Modules

Install the npm package, cat-names by running the command `npm install cat-names` in the terminal

```
npm install cat-names
```

Next, in `./src/index.js`, import `cat-names` (line 3), and use the package (line 5).

```jsx
import { cat } from './cat.js';
import { mouse } from './mouse.js';
import catNames from 'cat-names';

console.log(catNames.random());
console.log('cat', cat);
console.log('mouse', mouse);
```

Run the command `npx webpack` and look in `./dist/main.js` to see the how webpack has processed the package.

Not all packages can be compiled by Webpack. Try installing `pg`, importing `pg` in `src/script.js`, and re-running Webpack.
