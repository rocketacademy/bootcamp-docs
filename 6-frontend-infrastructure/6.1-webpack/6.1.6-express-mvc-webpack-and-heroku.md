# 6.1.6: Deploy Webpack App to Heroku

## Introduction

{% hint style="warning" %}
If our app uses Sequelize and we haven't configured it for production yet, we will need to configure Sequelize for production (i.e. Heroku deployment) by following instructions in [4.1.10: Deploy Sequelize App to Heroku](../../4-backend-structure/4.1-orm-sequelize/4.1.10-deploy-sequelize-app-to-heroku.md) before deployment. See the Sequelize config and `models/index.mjs` in Rocket's [Webpack example repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp/tree/full-example) for a sample.
{% endhint %}

To ensure our Webpack functionality works when deployed to Heroku, we need to add `build` and `start` scripts to `package.json` as per [6.1.5: Webpack with Express](6.1.5-webpack-with-express.md#add-node-scripts-to-run-webpack). If you haven't already, ensure those scripts are in `package.json`.

## Build Script

When we push to Heroku, Heroku automatically runs `npm run build` and `npm start`. Run `npm run build` locally on the command line to observe what happens: Webpack compiles files into the `dist` folder. Testing this locally can help us pre-empt any issues when deploying to Heroku.

## Add `dist` Folder to .gitignore

If we haven't already, add the `.dist` folder to `.gitignore`. We do not want to commit our `dist` files to GitHub because `dist` will contain imported code from `node_modules`, code that can be re-installed with `npm i` and re-Webpack-ed with Webpack on-demand. There is no need to store it in GitHub and bloat our repo. See `dist` in `.gitignore` on GitHub [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp/blob/full-example/.gitignore#L7).
