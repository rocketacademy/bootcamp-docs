### Overview

Rocket's Bootcamp syllabus is divided into modules (listed in the table below). Each module covers key topics in software engineering that are highly relevant in today's industry. Our course schedules and content are subject to minor alterations as we strive to fulfil the changing needs of our students and the industry.

### Module 1: Basics Continued

This part of the program is mostly a continuation of the work done in Coding Basics, with the pace and technical complexity increased to Bootcamp levels.

* Expand upon basics work to understand the wider context of JavaScript in the browser.
* Ramp up the complexity of programs we write.
* Introduce new levels of program abstraction, representation & complexity.
* Create mobile-responsive web layouts with CSS

### Module 2,3,4,5: Web Application Fundamentals

The part of the program builds knowledge of web applications from the ground up, starting with running a simple one-line program and building up to a complex internet and data-backed application. Even though some of the content is not the latest industry-relevant technologies, these modules provide fundamental knowledge and practice in how the disparate parts of modern web applications are constructed, by constructing one yourself, piece-by-piece.

* Introduce system-level runtime environment with Node.js
* Introduction to HTTP & Internet fundamentals
* Database & data storage fundamentals
* Web authentication
* Backend application fundamentals with NPM
* Web 2.0 full-stack architecture
* MVC
* Cloud deployment with Heroku

### Module 6,7: Modern Web Application Fundamentals, Core Libraries & Architectures

These modules transition towards a modern, full-stack application by adding on necessary layers to encapsulate and abstract parts of the system we had previously constructed “by hand”.

* Modern web-application architecture with Webpack
* Managed cloud deployment with Heroku
* React.js front-end DOM libraries & architecture

### Module 8: Final Form

This module is the summation of all previous material, culminating in the final form of our app, incorporating the latest libraries and technologies.

* Front-end & Backend isolation with Create React App
* Front-end state management with reducers
* Popular React Libraries

#### Project Requirements

The goal of each project is to demonstrate working knowledge of the the concepts learned in the previous modules. Project completion is a requirement to continue in bootcamp. If any project is not completed up to the given project requirements, that student may no longer be eligible to continue in bootcamp.
