# 2.ICE.3: Disk Altering

## Setup

Start with the [base Node repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-bootcamp).

## JavaScript Processor

Read in a JavaScript file. Change all the comments from `//` style to `/* */`. Keep them on the same line.

#### script.js

```javascript
// Add 2 numbers and return the result
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

#### Sample Command

```
node index.js script.js
```

#### Subsequent script.js

```javascript
/* a function that adds two numbers together */
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

### Variable Number of Images in HTML

Start with a file `output.html` that contains the following.

{% code title="output.html" %}
```markup
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Hello, world!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>ml
  </body>
</html>
```
{% endcode %}

1. Write a script `html.js` that accepts a number of `img` tags (with placeholder images) to render in a target file's HTML body.
2. The 2nd command line parameter to `html.js` will be the number of images to render.
3. [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos) is an image generator we can use to insert placeholder images in our `img` tags.
4. Update the HTML body in the target file specified by the 1st command line param to include the `img` tags.

```
node html.js output.html 4
```

## More Comfortable

### Photo Gallery

```
node html.js output.html /path/to/photos
```

1. Update `html.js` to accept a path parameter to a folder that contains images.
2. Use `fs` to copy each of the image files into the current folder.
3. For each image file, insert an `img` tag into the HTML body of the target file with the correct relative path.
