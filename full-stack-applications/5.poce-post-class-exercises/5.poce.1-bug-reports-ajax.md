# 5.POCE.1: Bug Reports AJAX

## Introduction

Create an app that tracks bugs.

## Setup

### Starter Repo

Begin with the [`ajax-bugs-bootcamp` repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/ajax-bugs-bootcamp).

### Database Schema

#### `Bugs` Table

| column name | data type | description | example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | ID | 1 |
| problem | TEXT | Description of the problem. | Crashes on POST request. |
| error\_text | TEXT | Error output text, if any. | Cannot set property "fill" of null. |
| commit | TEXT | Git commit hash of solution. | 961f1c |
| feature\_id | Foreign Key | Foreign Feature Key | 1 |

**`Features` Table**

| column name | data type | description | example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | ID | 1 |
| name | TEXT | Name of the feature | Navbar |

## Base

### Requirements

1. Seed the `features` table with a few common app features.
2. When our app renders the bug creation form, make an AJAX request to get a list of all features.
3. Represent each feature with a radio button in the bug creation form. \(Only 1 feature can be selected at a time.\)
4. When a user submits the bug creation form, send the selected feature's ID as `featureId` in the POST request.
5. Write JS in a JS file in the `public` folder, and import it using a script tag in the relevant EJS file.

### Sample Wireframes

1. Top: Create Bug Form. Feature radio buttons.
2. Middle: Bug List.
3. Bottom: Create Feature Form.

## Comfortable

### Retrieve Bug List with AJAX

When the page loads, retrieve the list of bugs and render them onto the page.

### Create Bug Form Validation

Make sure users can't submit the create bug form unless they have populated the "bug problem" field and selected a feature.

### Create Feature Form

Add a section to the page that renders a form to create features in the DB.

## More Comfortable

### Group By Feature

Create a toggle button that groups bugs by feature. When the user toggles the button, the page updates to group bugs by feature. When the user un-toggles the button, the page updates to default bug sorting by date created.

### Git Integration

The following features integrate our Bug Reports app with a chosen Git repo. Use our most recent Bird Watcher project repo for these features. Do the following to set up this integration.

1. Add a folder to the root of the Bird Watcher repo called `bug-tracker`.
2. Add `bug-tracker` to `.gitignore` in the Bird Watcher repo to avoid committing `bug-tracker`.
3. Clone \_\_a **new copy** of your Bug Reports repo into the `bug-tracker` folder.
4. Delete the `.git` folder in the Bug Reports repo so that Git commands from the Bug Reports app run on the Bird Watcher repo instead of the Bug Reports repo.

The following features rely on the above Git integration.

### Latest Commit

Add a button that retrieves and displays the latest commit hash and message of the project. When our server receives the request, run `git log` on the server inside the project repo to retrieve information about the latest commit.

### Commit List

When creating a bug, let the user select from a list of commits to associate with the bug. Retrieve the list of commits using an AJAX request to the server.
