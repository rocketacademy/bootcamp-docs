# 8.POCE.2: \(Group Project\) Rock Climbing Trip Planner

## Introduction

![](../../.gitbook/assets/279616_31645_l2.jpg)

You and your friends are making a trip to Krabi to rock climb. You want to plan ahead and know what routes to hit and in what order.

This is a group project. Please review the [Group Work module](../../course-logistics/group-work.md) to learn more about group workflow. Note there is no need to implement user login for this app.

## User Stories

1. The user wants to create a trip that contains the list of everything they want to climb.
2. The user wants to add a single route/location to the list of places.
3. The user wants to reorder the list of routes according to their preference
4. The user wants to record the difficulty of the climb so they can order it in the list better.
5. Use the [YDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_Decimal_System) to record the difficulty. This is a scale from 1-4 and 5.0 to 5.15.

## Getting Started

Begin by forking this backend starter code repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/climbing-trip-backend-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/climbing-trip-backend-bootcamp). The backend starter repo contains two DB tables: `trips` and `routes`. There is a 1-to-many relationship between`trips` and `routes`.

Use Create React App in a separate repo for the frontend.

## Comfortable

Decide in your team what other features you would like to include in the app. Try to practise the advanced React techniques we learned in Module 8, in preparation for [Project 5](../../projects/project-5-group-react-app.md).
