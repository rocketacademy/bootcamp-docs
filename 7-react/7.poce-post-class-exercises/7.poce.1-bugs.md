# 7.POCE.1: Bugs

## Introduction

Render an array of objects using JSX.

## Setup

1. Begin with the base Webpack repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp.git](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp.git)
2. Follow the instructions in [Module 7.1: JSX](https://github.com/rocketacademy/bootcamp-docs/blob/master/7-react/7.1-jsx-intro#setup) to set up Webpack for React.
3. Copy the contents of [this JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rocketacademy/bootcamp-docs/master/fixture-data/bugs.json) into `index.js`. You can also make a module for this data if you would like.

## Base

Render the data in the array onto the screen. The HTML should look like the following.

```markup
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>id: 1</p>
        <p>problem: Use the back-end PCI panel, then you can copy the 1080p card!</p>
        <p>error text: We need to override the auxiliary PNG pixel!</p>

        <p>feature: alarm-calculate</p>
    </li>
    [...]
</ul>
```

## Comfortable

1. Install [Moment.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) and format the dates to [time from now.](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/fromnow/)
2. Use CSS so that each of the features is coloured the same colour.
