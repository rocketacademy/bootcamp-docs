# 7.POCE.3: Read Later

Create an app that lists articles to read later.

## Base

Create a form and a submit button. When the user types a link into the text box and clicks submit, put that link into a list of links. Display the list of links.

## Comfortable

#### List component

Create a separate `LinkList` component.

Note that the list array data structures should still be stored in the parent component.

#### Read and Unread Lists

Add a checkbox for when the user has read a link. The link should be transferred to a new list of already read links.

#### Validate URLs

Add an [NPM library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/valid-url) that validates if the input is a valid URL. If it is not, show an error to the user. Don't put the link in the list.
