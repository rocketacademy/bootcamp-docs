# 7.POCE.3: Read Later

## Introduction

Create an app that stores a list of links to articles that you want to read at a later time.

![Sample UI for this app](../../.gitbook/assets/IMG\_0043.jpg)

## Setup

Begin with the [base React repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-express-base-bootcamp).

## Base

Create a form and a submit button. When the user types a link into the text box and clicks submit, put that link into a list of links. Display the list of links.

## Comfortable

### List component

Create a separate `LinkList` component that renders the list of links. Note that the list array data structures should still be stored in the parent component.

### Read and Unread Lists

Add a checkbox to mark when the user has read a link. The link should be transferred to a new list of already-read links.

### Validate URLs

Add an [NPM library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/valid-url) that validates if the input is a valid URL. If it is not, show an error to the user and do not add the link to the list.
