# 7.ICE.3: React Cards

## Introduction

Implement a 2-player High Card game using React. In each round of High Card each player draws 1 card from the deck and the player with the highest card wins.

## Setup

1. Begin with [RA's React Express Base repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-express-base-bootcamp)
2. Copy `shuffleCards` and `makeDeck` functions from [Module 1.5: High Card setTimeout](../../1-frontend-basics/1.3-high-card-dom.md) and paste them into the `App.jsx` file (or create a module for them).
3. Copy the `App` component starter code below into `App.jsx`. The code initialises the card deck state array variable and deals cards into player hands.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  // Set the default value of the deck
  const [cardDeck, setCardDeck] = useState(shuffleCards(makeDeck()));

  // Set the default player hand as empty
  const [playerHand, setPlayerHand] = useState([]);

  // Deal 2 cards into the player's hand and update the deck
  const dealCards = () => {
    const hand = [cardDeck.pop(), cardDeck.pop()];
    setPlayerHand(hand);
    setCardDeck([...cardDeck]);
  };

  // Render cards in the player hand
  // Note that when this renders the first time and the hand is
  // empty, it does not require a special condition.
  const handElems = playerHand.map(({ name, suit }) => (
    <div>
      {name}
      {suit}
    </div>
  ));

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>Cards:</h3>
        {handElems}
      </div>
      <p>
        <button onClick={dealCards}>Deal</button>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Base

Create a game of High Card by comparing the 2 cards drawn from the deck and determining a winner.

## Comfortable

1. Update the game to add a Play Hand button. The user can continue to deal cards to themselves with the Deal button.
2. When the user clicks the Play Hand button the computer is dealt the same amount of cards in the user's hand, and the player with the highest card in both hands wins.
3. The game ends when the deck is out of cards. When the deck is out of cards, reset the game to the starting values.

## More Comfortable

Update a scoreboard when the deck runs out of cards. The player who had more winning hands gets 1 point.
