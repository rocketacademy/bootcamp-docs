# 5.ICE.3: Bug Reports AJAX

Create an app that tracks bugs in a code base.

Begin by _**forking**_ cloning [the starter repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/ajax-bugs-bootcamp) This is also the POCE for today.

### Database Schema

#### Bug Table (`bugs`)

| column name | data type          | description                    | example                             |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| id          | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | ID                             | 1                                   |
| problem     | TEXT               | Description of the problem.    | Crashes on POST request.            |
| errorText   | TEXT               | Error output text, if any.     | Cannot set property "fill" of null. |
| commit      | TEXT               | Associated Git commit, if any. | 961f1c                              |

## Base

Create a route for root `/` and a corresponding view. The EJS file for this view can contain static elements that we will modify using DOM manipulation with an imported script file.

When the page loads, display a button. The call to action is "Create a bug". When the user clicks the button, a form appears for them to fill out. (Note: do not use an HTML `form` element because HTML forms refresh the page on submit. Use a series of `input` elements instead.)

When the user clicks the submit button, the JS takes the values and sends them in a POST request to the server (without refreshing the page). The server creates a bug in the database. When the response gets back to the browser, the form disappears from the page. A bug is added to the list of bugs.
