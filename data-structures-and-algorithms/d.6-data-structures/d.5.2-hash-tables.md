# D.5.2: Hash Tables

## Introduction

Hash tables are the generalised computer-science concept behind JavaScript Objects. Most programming languages have their own implementation of hash tables, e.g. Dictionaries in Python, HashMaps in Java.

## Hash Table Theory

See [this slide deck ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15nBnrcsigXujmNuIAa6QZ0dGr8E1JeWHVdtmPukuGno/edit?usp=sharing)for concise hash table theory compiled by one of RA's former instructors Lionell.

## Python Dictionary Usage Examples

See [this Repl](https://repl.it/@kaiyuanneo/hashmapapplications#main.py) on common Python Dictionary usage patterns compiled by one of RA's former instructors Jon.

### Leetcode

The following are 40+ Easy-level hash-table-specific problems on Leetcode. Please complete as many as you can. You can ignore problems with a lock icon next to them because those require a Leetcode Premium subscription. Once you've attempted each problem, find solutions in the Discuss tab on that problem's page.
