# UX.1: Overview

## UX and Projects

When we work on the Rocket projects the main goal will always be the technical implementation of a software application given some goals and a set of technologies. However, for writing any software it is very important to be able to keep the high-level goals in mind. In the case of web and internet technologies these are usually focused around human users. To that end it's important to learn some why a product may or may not include some functionality and to be able to think about those reasons from first principles.

### Web Software is for Users

During each project the goal should be, in addition to the technical execution, to be able to rationalize about the project's usefulness to a hypothetical user. It is an important and valuable aspect of creating user-facing software to be able to understand the decision making process behind the technical implementation.

## What are we creating?

The context of the projects can be put in the context of building a green-field digital product, and the workflow that most closely resembles that idea would be a digital product startup. This video describes a common approach to building a company around a new idea and how the idea can turn into a successful business if it solves a real user problem.

The video is a summary of the popular business strategy book [The Lean Startup by Eric Ries](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898).

What kind of approach can we take to build a digital product? The term (buzz-word) for the umbrella process (that includes the lean startup methodology described above) is **design thinking.** Design thinking is a way to approach creating things that are useful for users.
